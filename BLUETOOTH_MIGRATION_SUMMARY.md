# Bluetooth Library Migration Summary

## ✅ Migration Completed Successfully

### What Was Changed

1. **Removed androidx.bluetooth dependency**
   - Removed `implementation("androidx.bluetooth:bluetooth:1.0.0-alpha01")` from `app/build.gradle.kts`
   - Updated comment to indicate native Android Bluetooth APIs are being used

2. **Updated BleManager.kt to use modern native Android Bluetooth APIs**
   - Replaced deprecated `BluetoothAdapter.LeScanCallback` with modern `ScanCallback`
   - Added proper imports for `android.bluetooth.le.*` classes
   - Implemented proper scan state management with `isScanning` flag
   - Used `BluetoothLeScanner` for modern BLE scanning
   - Added proper error handling for scan failures

### Current Implementation Status

✅ **Native Android Bluetooth APIs**: All Bluetooth functionality now uses `android.bluetooth.*` classes
✅ **Android 7+ Support**: `minSdk = 24` is perfect for this implementation
✅ **Modern BLE Scanning**: Uses `ScanCallback` and `BluetoothLeScanner` (API 21+)
✅ **Proper Permissions**: All required Bluetooth permissions are in `AndroidManifest.xml`
✅ **UI Integration**: MainScreen.kt properly displays discovered BLE devices

### Key Features

- **BLE Device Discovery**: Scans for fusion nodes using native APIs
- **GATT Connection Management**: Handles BLE connections and service discovery
- **Characteristic Communication**: Sends/receives messages via BLE characteristics
- **Permission Handling**: Proper runtime permission checks for Android 6+
- **State Management**: Tracks connection and scanning states

### Technical Details

- **Target API**: 36 (Android 14)
- **Minimum API**: 24 (Android 7.0)
- **Bluetooth APIs Used**:
  - `BluetoothManager` - System service access
  - `BluetoothAdapter` - Bluetooth state management
  - `BluetoothLeScanner` - Modern BLE scanning
  - `BluetoothGatt` - GATT client operations
  - `ScanCallback` - Modern scan results
  - `ScanSettings` - Scan configuration

### Benefits of Native Implementation

1. **Better Performance**: Direct access to system Bluetooth stack
2. **Wider Compatibility**: Works on all Android 7+ devices
3. **No External Dependencies**: Reduces APK size and potential conflicts
4. **Future-Proof**: Uses official Android APIs that are actively maintained
5. **Better Integration**: Seamless integration with Android permission system

### No Further Action Required

The migration is complete and your app is now using native Android Bluetooth APIs with full Android 7+ support. The `minSdk = 24` setting is perfect for this implementation.
